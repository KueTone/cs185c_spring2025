Welcome to my ocean modeling repository! This repository is designed to host and store my notes on modeling the Earth's Ocean using Python and Jupyter Notebook, receiving data from MITgcm and GEBCO, which has Bathymetry Data. 

There are two key directories in this repository:

## Homework
The homework directory is for storing, managing, and turning in weekly homework assignments.

## Project
For this class's final project, I will research the effects of Typhoons on the Philippine Region. Specifically, I will be finding the answer to this question: 

_How does climate change and the increase of global temperatures affect Typhoon activity?_

To investigate, I will construct my model on the Philippines and surrounding regions and run the model for two separate years, focusing primarily on the years 1998 and 2024, when the Philippines had La Nina, bringing in more precipitation. I anticipate the model to have an increase in Typhoon activity over the years due to increase in global temperatures. These years were chosen from  [Columbia' Climate Prediction Center ENSO Forecast ](https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/?enso_tab=enso-sst_image). For my project, I will be primarily using data from the ECCO Version 5 model in the years provided. During those years, I will observe each month to month. I observe results through timeseries that analyzes the Ocean temperatures and investigate the differences over time. For visualization, I will create a movie of temperature differences between the model with wind and the model without wind.

Before running this experiment, my initial hypothesis on the quesetion is that Typhoon activity has been increasing over the years. The reasoning behind this is that La Nina becomes more intense over the year due to increases in the ranges of global temperatures, which will in turn, generate more typhoons that wreck the Phillipines. During these La Nina years in the Phillipines, rainfall increases.
